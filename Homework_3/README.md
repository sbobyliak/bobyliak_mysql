I have chosen rozetka website as e-commerce business model to work with. 

I started with thinking of processes, their reflection in tables and creating a lineage graph. 
First three tables were sell, buy and transactions as key actions on the website. This is raw layer where all data was collected. 
Then on stage layer i divided first three tables into five and cleaned to have unique valves. 
As a result we have tables sellers, seller services (if shops have any service centres), customers and orders. 
On march layer i applied dimensional modeling. Orders is now fact table with numeric data and keys to other tables. 
Stage orders table was divided into fact-orders and dim-order-details. 
Other tables are treated as dimensional. Also i implemented some changes to make raw data more appropriate for analization. 
For example extracted from column join-date new column user-life, to see how many months user was on the website. 
And i counted final price paid by user subtracting bonus that user has from item price

After all i created some simple queries to show that my dwh works effectively
